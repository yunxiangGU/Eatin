## Background

Eatin is an online restaurant reservation, which aims to offer both customers and restaurants a place to manage their reservations. On customer side, they can search, filter, and make bookings simply on the same web page. On merchant side, they are able to utilise our management system to better organise their reservation data.

Since this is a classic web application, we are using Play framework with Scala to organise our projects. In terms of data storage, we are going to use MySql database for long-lasting data, and Redis for caching availability data. For front-end, we are using React framework to make best use of existing libraries and better encapsulate components.

Because the time is limited for our project, we have implemented most of the basic features above while leaving rest of them for future.

## Run Eatin!

We chose to focus on back-end while also offer some front-end features implemented by React. To start this project, you should first clone this repository from https://github.com/yunxiangGU/Eatin:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yunxiangGU/Eatin.git
cd Eatin
```

The project structure is classic Play structure with a front-end `ui` folder. To start the web application, back-end and front-end services should both be started successfully. In addition, we use MySQL as persistent storage so the corresponding database and tables need to be initialised as **Appendix(a)** described. To connect the local database successfully, the following part of `conf/application.conf` need to be modified to valid values:

```scala
slick.dbs.default.db.user="root"
slick.dbs.default.db.password="pass"
```

To start backend, use `sbt` (`Java version 8 or 11`).

```sh
sbt compile
sbt run
```

To start frontend, `npm` required.

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

By default, back end will start on port 9000, while front end will start on port 3000.

## Implementation Details

## a. Database:


1. User

```sql
CREATE TABLE `eatin`.`user` (
  `userid` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` VARCHAR(45) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  `password` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `email` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `type` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`userid`),
  INDEX `username` (`username` ASC) VISIBLE);

```

2. Restaurant

```sql
CREATE TABLE `eatin`.`restaurant` (
  `rest_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `userid` INT NOT NULL,
  `name` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  `desc` VARCHAR(1024) NULL,
  `address` VARCHAR(256) NULL,
  `phone` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `open_id` INT NOT NULL,
  `tables` INT NOT NULL,
  `rest_type` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`rest_id`, `userid`));

```

3. Open hours:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `eatin`.`open_hours` (
  `open_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,
  `breakfast` TINYINT NOT NULL,
  `lunch` TINYINT NOT NULL,
  `dinner` TINYINT NOT NULL,
  `b_start` TIME NULL,
  `b_end` TIME NULL,
  `l_start` TIME NULL,
  `l_end` TIME NULL,
  `d_start` TIME NULL,
  `d_end` TIME NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`open_id`));

```



4. Reservation

```sql
CREATE TABLE `eatin`.`reservation` (
  `reserve_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `datetime` DATETIME NOT NULL,
  `rest_id` INT NOT NULL,
  `userid` INT NOT NULL,
  `duration` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  `status` TINYINT NOT NULL, 
  PRIMARY KEY (`reserve_id`, `date`, `rest_id`, `userid`));

```
